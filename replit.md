## System Architecture

### Frontend Architecture

**React SPA with Vite Build System**
- Single-page application built with React 18 and TypeScript
- Vite as the build tool and development server for fast hot module replacement
- Wouter for client-side routing (lightweight alternative to React Router)
- Component-based architecture with reusable UI elements

**UI Component Library**
- shadcn/ui component system (New York style variant) using Radix UI primitives
- Tailwind CSS for utility-first styling with custom theme configuration
- Custom design system following modern developer portfolio aesthetics (inspired by Linear, Vercel, GitHub)
- Dark mode as primary theme with light mode support via CSS variables

**State Management & Data Fetching**
- TanStack Query (React Query) for async state management
- No external API calls in current implementation - portfolio content is static/hardcoded
- Toast notifications for user feedback using Radix UI Toast primitives

**Styling & Theming**
- Custom color palette defined in CSS variables (HSL format)
- Typography: Inter for body/UI, Space Grotesk for headings (Google Fonts)
- Consistent spacing system using Tailwind's spacing units
- Elevation system with hover/active states for interactive elements

### Backend Architecture

**Express.js Server**
- Minimal Express server serving the React SPA
- Development mode integrates Vite middleware for HMR
- Production mode serves pre-built static files
- Request logging middleware for API routes

**Route Structure**
- `/api/*` prefix reserved for API endpoints (currently minimal/placeholder implementation)
- All other routes serve the React SPA (client-side routing)

**Session & Storage Layer**
- In-memory storage implementation (`MemStorage` class) as placeholder
- Interface defined for future database integration
- User schema defined but not actively used in current portfolio implementation
- Session management with `connect-pg-simple` configured but not actively utilized

### Database Schema

**Drizzle ORM Configuration**
- PostgreSQL as target database (via Neon serverless driver)
- Schema location: `shared/schema.ts`
- Migration files output to `./migrations` directory
- Single users table defined with UUID primary key, username, and password fields

**Current Status**
- Database schema exists but is not actively used by the portfolio
- The portfolio content is static and does not require database persistence
- Schema appears to be scaffolding for future authentication/user features
